###### Why Design Patterns?

###### What is a Design Pattern?

So getting started then, what exactly is a Design Pattern? Here are a couple of definitions for the term:

Extracted from Wikipedia:

"A design pattern in architecture and computer science is a formal way of documenting a solution to a design problem in a particular field of expertise."

Extracted from Data & Object Factory:

"Design patterns are recurring solutions to software design problems you find again and again in real-world application development. Patterns are about design and interaction of objects, as well as providing a communication platform concerning elegant, reusable solutions to commonly encountered programming challenges. "

So a Design Pattern is a general purpose abstraction of a problem, which can be applied to a specific solution. As software developers tend to solve many similar types of problems, it makes sense that any software solution would incorporate similar elements from other solutions. Why reinvent the wheel?

###### Well Documented and Understood

As Design Patterns are well documented and understood by software architects, designers and developers, then their application within a specific solution will likewise be well understood.

Design Patterns give the software developer an array of tried and tested solutions to common problems, thus reducing the technical risk to the project by not having to employ a new and untested design.

Design Patterns may not initially lead to a reduction in development timescales, as there is a learning curve if the team are unfamiliar with them. However, looking further down the development pipeline, once familiarity with them increases, development timescales should gradually reduce.

###### Benefits of Using Design patterns

Design Patterns provide the following benefits:

* They give the developer a selection of tried and tested solutions to work with.
* They are language neutral so they can be applied to any language that supports object-orientation.
* They aid communication by the very fact that they are well documented and can be researched if that is not the case.
* They have a proven track record as they are already widely used and thus reduce the technical risk to the project.
* They are highly flexible and can be used in practically any type of application or domain.
